# Installation

Place the `vee` command in your `$PATH`.

Then, in your `~/.bashrc`, add the following line:

    source vee

Alternatively, you can run the command with the full path of `vee` instead of having it in your `$PATH`. Once it has been sourced by the above-mentioned command, a globally available `bash` function has been set, also named `vee`.

From then on, you may call `vee` from the command line, regardless of whether the script itself is in the `$PATH` or not.

# Work-in-progress

This project is in its infancy and it's not entirely clear how it should work in the near future, so please just read the source code to get a grasp of what it does.
